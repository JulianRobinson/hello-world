# hello-world

Hello, I am Julian Robinson. I am currently a Computer Science student at Kennesaw State University.
I am into cybersecurity and web development. One day I hope to own my own software consulting company!

Superhero tv shows/movies, video games, and sports (play me 1 on 1 in basketball) are hobbies I enjoy. 
Overall I hope to learn a lot about programming and master my craft!
